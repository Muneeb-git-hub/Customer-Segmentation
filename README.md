# Customer-Segmentation
This project performs customer segmentation using unsupervised machine learning techniques to identify distinct groups within a customer base. By analyzing customer data  the system uses clustering algorithms like K-Means to group similar customers together. The project includes comprehensive data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature scaling, determining optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score, model training, and visualization of customer segments. The resulting segments enable businesses to develop targeted marketing strategies, personalize customer experiences, improve retention, and optimize resource allocation. Each segment is profiled with key characteristics to provide actionable insights for business decision-making.
